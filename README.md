# A checklist for reporting crowdsourcing experiments

In this repository, we introduce a checklist to aid authors in being thorough and systematic when describing the design and operationalization of their crowdsourcing experiments. The checklist also aims to help readers navigate and understand the underlying details behind crowdsourcing studies. Our work aims to push towards more transparent and consistent reporting, enabling a better assessment of the validity and reproducibility of experiments in crowdsourcing research.

**Abstract**
> Crowdsourcing is being increasingly adopted as a platform to run studies with human subjects. Running a crowdsourcing experiment involves several choices and strategies to successfully port an experimental design into an otherwise uncontrolled research environment, e.g., sampling crowd workers, mapping experimental conditions to micro-tasks, or ensure quality contributions. While several guidelines inform researchers in these choices, guidance of how and what to report from crowdsourcing experiments has been largely overlooked. If under-reported, implementation choices constitute variability sources that can affect the experiment's reproducibility and prevent a fair assessment of research outcomes. In this paper, we examine the current state of reporting of crowdsourcing experiments and offer guidance to address associated reporting issues. We start by identifying sensible implementation choices, relying on existing literature and interviews with experts, to then extensively analyze the reporting of 171 crowdsourcing experiments. Informed by this process, we propose a checklist for reporting crowdsourcing experiments.
